<p>I am an Irishman who recently moved to Paris to challenge myself and to discover new opportunities within the creative realm! As you can see here on my CV, I have recently finished over a year’s work with the internationally renowned architecture firm Grafton Architects - a job that I got after graduating with a first class honours degree in Architecture (B.Sc.).
You may be wondering how architecture experience is relevant to you, however, I feel that the multiple visual design and presentation skills that I learned whilst studying architecture as well as the conscientious and tenacious work ethic that I developed in college could be invaluable to you.
My main interests come under the umbrella of visual design but I have also encountered some web design in the past, especially during my time as digital content manager at Camerakit. At that job I really got to dig under the skin of a working website and learnt the capabilities of both HTML and CSS coding languages.
I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at my CV to see all the ways that I can help you.
